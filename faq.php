             You may not be the only seller offering a particular product. Thus, it can be beneficial to differentiate your listing by providing accurate, concise and detailed information on your product detail page. One way to do this is to think like a customer. This means taking into account the types of questions they may ask and the kind of information they seek. You can also consider their purchase journey to understand how you can better position your product.
